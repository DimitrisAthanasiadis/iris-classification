# Neuro Fuzzy Classification of Iris Data Set
This project is part of our Intelligent Systems course.

The main purpose of the project is to solve a classification problem with Matlab, using the fuzzy toolbox and the takagi-sugeno inference system.
We chose to solve the famous iris classification problem.

As part of the project we also had to write a paper about fuzzy systems and include our solution to the problem.
Finally, at the end of the course we had to make the presentation about everything we learnt and show our solution to the problem.
